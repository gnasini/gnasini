### :fire: Hello, I'm Guido! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a community-taught developer from Argentina.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing an e-commerce site using GraphQL, Keystone.js, Next.js, and Stripe.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about AWS and Node.js to be able to create a truly scalable app for thousands of users. I'm also sharpening my GraphQL skills.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about books--fantasy books in particular. But, going back to the tech, we can have a nice conversation about app ideas for potential startups, or React along with its ecosystem. I also enjoy finance and economy in general, so we can talk crypto and stocks (especially GME :full_moon: :rocket:).
- :octopus: In the near future I'm planning on learning Typescript once and for all.
- ðŸ“« If you want to contact me, send me and email at gnasini.ds@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can--sort of--speak backwards. I have personally bestowed the title of most useless talent in the world to this particular ability.
