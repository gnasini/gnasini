### :fire: Hello, I'm ng! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from Argentina.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a social media app dedicated to short fantasy fiction. The stack is Postgres | Next.js | Express | TypeORM | Typescript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about Solidity and Web3.
- ðŸ“« If you want to contact me, send me and email at ngndev94@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can--sort of--speak backwards. I have personally bestowed the title of most useless talent in the world to this particular ability.
