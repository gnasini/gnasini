### :fire: Hello, I'm Guido! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from Argentina.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing a social media app called 500Tales dedicated to sharing short fiction. The tech stack is MongoDB | GraphQL | NextJS | Apollo | Mongoose
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about AWS.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about books--fantasy books in particular. But, going back to the tech, we can have a nice conversation about app ideas, or React along with its ecosystem. I also enjoy finance and economy in general, so we can talk crypto and stocks.
- ðŸ“« If you want to contact me, send me and email at gnasini.ds@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can--sort of--speak backwards. I have personally bestowed the title of most useless talent in the world to this particular ability.
